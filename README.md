# GC Couture

## Overview
This Java program provides an easy-to-use GUI which allows the user to analyze and visualize positional GC content from a coordinate-sorted SAM file.

***

## Features
### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Point to the coordinate-sorted SAM file.
- Point to an output directory
- Select a number of threads
- View the total analysis runtime

### Output & Reporting
- A wiggle file to visualize positional GC content from the directory of coordinate-sorted SAM files.
- A .tsv file for visualization and analysis in non-IGV tools like R. 

***

## Usage 
### Prerequisites
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Interactive Genome Viewer (IGV)

### Instructions
#### Launch the program.
- Using the GUI, select the coordinate-sorted SAM file you would like to analyze.
- Select the output directory you would like to store the SAM file in.
- Initiate analysis.
- View results through generated wiggle and .tsv files, and visualize positional GC content by uploading the wiggle file to IGV.

#### Sample coordinate-sorted SAM file can be found here: https://studentuncc-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/aalexa77_uncc_edu/EWTomnudFfVDkge1K98W7wwBY0ZK3SErsrPS5pgGXaRUjA?e=VU86dC

#### Launch IGV 
- Select "Load from File"

- Select the wiggle (.wig) file generated by GC Couture.

- Right-click on the track name and select "Line Plot" for easier visualization

## Future Development
- Select a sliding window size for GC content analysis.
- Choose whether to output a wiggle file for visualization of GC content in IGV.
- Generate a convenient summary file with critical quality statistics.
- Choose whether to iterate through a directory of SAM files. 

## Development Details
- A GUI will prompt the user for:
  - A directory containing coordinate-sorted .sam files to be analyzed.
  - A sliding window size to determine the resolution at which GC content is scanned across each read in each .sam file. 

- Program will scan across reads using the user-provided sliding window size. Storing the position and GC content of each position.

- Using the [Position:GC Content] from each sample, a 'wiggle' file (.wig) can be generated to visualize the data in IGV.
